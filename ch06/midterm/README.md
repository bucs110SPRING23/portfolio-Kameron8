# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION My program takes user input about the size of a pizza, pepperoni preference, and the number of slices the user wants their pizza to be cut into. This creates a unique pizza each time you run the program. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS Nope

## REFERENCES I used pen.dot() which I found online at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-dot-function-in-python/

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS I know the placing_pepperoni() function may look similar in the final product to the dartboard labs we did, but the actual math and logsitics behind the function ended up being pretty different due to the different coordinate grids used between pygame and turtle, the fact I didn't want any part of the pepperonis to overlap the crust, and since I wanted a certain number of pepperonis on each pizza (dependent on the size of the pizza) as opposed to hardcoding a particular value.
